# Implementation-of-Symmetric-cipher-algorithm-AES-and-RC4-
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - Block cipher, encrypts data in 128-bit blocks - Key sizes: 128, 192, and 256 bits - Secure and efficient  RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) - Stream cipher, encrypts data in a continuous stream - Variable key size (40-2048 bits) - Fast, but has known security vulnerabilities
