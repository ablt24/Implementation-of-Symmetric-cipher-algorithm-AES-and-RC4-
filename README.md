# Implementation of Symmetric Cipher Algorithms: AES and RC4

## 🔐 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- Block cipher: encrypts data in 128-bit blocks
- Key sizes: 128, 192, and 256 bits
- Secure and efficient for various applications

## 🔐 RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)
- Stream cipher: encrypts data in a continuous stream
- Variable key size (40–2048 bits)
- Fast but has known security vulnerabilities

# AES and RC4 Encryption in Python

This repository provides simple Python implementations of:
1. **AES (ECB mode)** using `pycryptodome`
2. **RC4 stream cipher** implemented from scratch

## Features
- AES encryption and decryption with padding
- RC4 encryption and decryption using KSA and PRGA
